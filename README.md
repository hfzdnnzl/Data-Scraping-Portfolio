# Data Scraping Portfolio
Welcome to my data scraping portfolio! In this repository, you'll find folders for each website containing Python notebooks with scraping code and CSV files containing the scraped data. Below is an overview of the contents and instructions for navigating through the portfolio.

## Introduction
Data scraping is a crucial skill for extracting valuable information from websites. This portfolio showcases my expertise in web scraping by providing Python notebooks containing scraping scripts and the corresponding datasets obtained from various websites.

## Folder Structure
- findfunding.vc
  - Find-Funding-Scraping.ipynb
  - find_funding_companies.csv

Each website has its own folder containing a Jupyter notebook (scraping_code.ipynb) with the Python code used for scraping data from that specific website. Additionally, each folder includes a CSV file (data.csv) where the scraped data is stored.

## How to Use
To explore the scraping code and datasets:

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the website you are interested in.
2. Open the scraping_code.ipynb notebook to view the Python code used for scraping.
3. Execute the code cells within the notebook to understand the scraping process.
4. Open the data.csv file to access the scraped data and perform further analysis or visualization as needed.

Feel free to modify the code according to your requirements or extend it to scrape additional data from the respective websites.
